    Victus is a free interpretation of the aesthetic sense and functional purpose of  Bartolomeo Sanvito’s Renaissance manuscripts. Victus has formal features that identify it with the Venetian typographic model. The warmth of the carefully balanced calligraphic construction provides an evenness between the perception of the classic and modern visual standards. The family consists in four styles and twenty-two variants: Text and display, grouped in roman and italic with a range from thin to black.
